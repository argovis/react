						<h3>Intro</h3>

						<p>Argovis is a REST API and web application for searching, downloading, co-locating 
						and visualizing oceanographic data, including Argo array data, ship-based profile data,
						data from the Global Drifter Program, tropical cyclone data, and several gridded products. Our API
						is meant to be integrated into living documents like Jupyter notebooks and analyses intended to 
						update their consumption of Argo data in near-real-time, and our web frontend is intended to
						make it easy for students and educators to explore data about Earth's oceans at will.</p>

						<p>The <a href='https://argovis.colorado.edu/'>landing page</a> of Argovis shows colocated data. 
						For access to individual products (point or gridded data), 
						see the "Explore" menu, e.g. the Argo profile page is <a href='https://argovis.colorado.edu/argo'>here</a>.</p>

								<p><b>Bill Katie-Anne Mills</b> is a scientific software developer based in Brooklyn, NY. They
								started their career by developing novel reconstruction algorithms in high energy particle 
								physics for the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, and developed web apps for the nuclear
								structure community for years before heading to the private sector to teach organizations
								how to design and operate software at scale using Docker and Kubernetes. They are currently
								working in Prof. Giglio's group at University of Colorado Boulder as the lead engineer
								on Argovis.</p>

								<p><b>Tyler Tucker</b> lives and works (and plays) on the Big Island of Hawaii. He is currently
								a scientific software engineer at the W. M. Keck Observatory on the Big Island. In 2019-2020, he
								worked as a Research Assistant in Professor Giglio's group at University of Colorado Boulder. Tyler
								started developing Argovis as part of a Master's thesis entitled "Mathematics and big data technology
								development to visualize, deliver and analyze IMS and Argo data," defended in May 2018 at San Diego
								State University. The Argovis project started in 2017 when Tyler was an Applied Mathematics MS
								student at the Climate Informatics Lab, San Diego State University, supervised by Professor
								Samuel Shen, and working in collaboration with Donata Giglio and Megan Scanderbeg.</p>
